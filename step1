Phase 1: Planning & Scoping (The Blueprint)
First, we'll break down the application into its core components.
User Stories
These are simple descriptions of a feature from a user's perspective.
As a user, I want to...
...sign up for an account so I can have my own private list.
...log in to my account to see my tasks.
...see a list of all my to-do items.
...add a new to-do item to my list.
...mark a to-do item as "complete".
...delete a to-do item I no longer need.
...log out of my account.
Core Features (MVP - Minimum Viable Product)
Based on the stories, here are the features for our first version:
User Authentication: A system for users to sign up, log in, and log out. We'll start with a simple Google login to make it easy.
Task Dashboard: The main page where a logged-in user sees their tasks.
Task Creation: An input field and a button to create a new task.
Task State Management: A checkbox next to each task to toggle its completion status.
Task Deletion: A button to remove a task permanently.
Data Models
This is how we'll structure our data in the database. It's very simple for this project.
User Model:
id: A unique identifier for the user.
email: The user's email address (used for logging in).
name: The user's name.
image: A profile picture URL (provided by Google login).
todos: A list of all to-do items created by this user.
Todo Model:
id: A unique identifier for the task.
text: The content of the to-do item (e.g., "Buy milk").
completed: A true/false value indicating if the task is done.
createdAt: A timestamp for when the task was created.
userId: A link that connects this to-do item back to its owner, the User.
This plan gives us a clear roadmap. Now, let's choose our tools.
