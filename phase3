Phase 2: Choosing the Technology Stack (The Toolbox)
For this project, I recommend a modern and highly efficient stack. It's easy to set up and very powerful.
Framework: Next.js (React)
Database: PostgreSQL
ORM (Code-to-Database Link): Prisma
Authentication: NextAuth.js
Styling: Tailwind CSS
Deployment: Vercel & Supabase
The combination of Next.js, Prisma, Tailwind, and NextAuth is so popular and effective that it has a name: the T3 Stack. Luckily, there's a tool that sets up a new project with all of this pre-configured.
Action Step: Let's Set Up Your Project!
Now it's time to create the project on your local machine.
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project (e.g., cd ~/Desktop/Projects).
Run the following command. This will use the create-t3-app tool to build the project boilerplate for us.
Generated bash
npx create-t3-app@latest todo-app
Use code with caution.
Bash
The installer will ask you a few questions. Here's what I recommend you choose:
Will you be using JavaScript or TypeScript? -> TypeScript (It's safer and better for long-term projects).
Which packages will you be using? -> Use the spacebar to select/deselect. Make sure the following are checked:
NextAuth.js
Prisma
Tailwind CSS
tRPC (We will use this to make communication between your frontend and backend typesafe and incredibly easy).
Do you want to initialize a new git repository? -> Yes.
Do you want to run 'npm install'? -> Yes.
Would you like us to run 'prisma init' for you? -> No (The T3 stack handles this).
Would you like us to simplify the boilerplate? -> Yes.
After the installation is complete, navigate into your new project directory:
Generated bash
cd todo-app
Use code with caution.
Bash
Congratulations! You now have a complete, fully-configured full-stack project skeleton on your computer.
Our next step will be to set up the database using Prisma and define the User and Todo models we planned out. Are you ready for Phase 3?
